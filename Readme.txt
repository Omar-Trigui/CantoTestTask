Implement a small React app. This app should look like the app shown in „Mockup.png“. 

The app starts showing screen1 and shows two buttons („Approve“, „Reject“).
After click on „Approve“ the „check“-icon becomes visible over the image and a Reset button is shown. 
After click on „Reject“ the „close“-icon becomes visible over the image and a Reset button is shown. 
After click on „Reset“ the app goes back to initial state and shows the buttons „Approve“ and „Reject“. 

Use React and typescript and provide tests written in jest for all components. 
Please try to split the app in different components.
Take care of the responsiveness of the app. Smartphones don't need to be supported but it should look well on every resolution
 on a a desktop pc. (Min. Resolution: 1366x768, Max 4k)
